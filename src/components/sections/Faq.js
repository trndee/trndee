        Forecasting is the process of making predictions of the future based on

      <>
        Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically 
        through experience. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. Machine 
        learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as 
        "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly 
        programmed to do so

    title: 'What is our perspective?',

      <>
        We donâ€™t set limits based on what others think is possible or impossible. We drive 
        ourselves to push boundaries and solve problems. We continuously expand our knowledge 
        to find new answers.

        Not quite. But what we can do is to generate alternative scenarios of the 
        future and predict outcomes including both likely and unlikely futures.
